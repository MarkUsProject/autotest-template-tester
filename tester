# Write the actual tester here. This should be an executable that takes test settings as input through stdin,
# and prints test results to stdout as json in the following format:
{
    "test_name": # name of the test,
    "output": # any additional information provided by the test run (test result output for example),
    "marks_earned": # the number of marks earned by running this test,
    "marks_total": # the number of total possible marks that can be earned from running this test,
    "status": # a status code. One of: "pass", "fail", "partial", "error",
    "time": # the amount of time in milliseconds it took to run the test (optional)
}

# This tester can run multiple tests and each test should print a json string formatted as above to stdout.
# Do not print the json strings in an array, just print them one by one to stdout. For example, a tester should
# print:

{ "test_name": ... }
{ "test_name": ... }
{ "test_name": ... }

# as opposed to:

[
    { "test_name": ... },
    { "test_name": ... },
    { "test_name": ... }
]
